I understand the concepts in a vacuum, but i am mostly lost with the actual implementation with the code. I understand roughly what it is doing, but I didn't pick up the nuance.
The notebook is set up and it claims that it is already ready to go ("student-ready, simplified, and fully runnable"), but some things don't work. 
The parameters we were supposed to change only changed the output of #6 and #7; the ablation tables didn't change. The only change the tables had was in the number of chunks for one of the questions when I changed the keywords in the query. The chunk parameters we could change were not hooked up to anything in the code, and I'm not sure where to put that.

As for evaluations, while the actual precision and recall wouldn't change when I changed the parameters, the chunks and images generated by #7 made logical sense and they had the right words and context. Only once did I notice the chunk selection failing by completely misunderstanding the context of the chunk.

I would try to debug but the code only just started clicking and I am very tired.
